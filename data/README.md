The csv files provided here contain reorganized data from raw numbers available to public in the following sources:
- [Nintendo Sales](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html)
- [Playstation Sales](https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/)

## Nintendo data 

It has a few breakdowns available by region, models (in ten thousand units).  

It also provides aggregated software sales for each product group (e.g. games for Nintendo Switch, compatible with all three models).  

Year aggregates are labeled `FY3/YYYY`. I understand it means sales from April `YYYY-1` to March `YYYY`.  


## Playstation data 

Only provides aggregated hardware unit sales (in Millions of units).  

Year aggregates are labeled `FY YYYY`. I understand it means sales from April `YYYY` to March `YYYY + 1`. Thus, beware to align dates when comparing to Nintendo data.
